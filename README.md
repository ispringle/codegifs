# codegifs

A blatant knockoff of the board game Codenames, but with gifs

## Usage
Uh... not usable?

But you can just build the docker image and then run it to see what's up I guess :)

```
docker build -tag codegifs .
docker run -p 80:8080 -d codegifs
```

Then navigate to `localhost` and see all my hard work.

Also availabe with `docker pull pard68/codegifs:latest`
